# Release v0.1.9

## ✨ Highlights

- **Provider Plugin API completed**: plugin SDK now supports `register_providers` in addition to `register_tools` and `register_channels`.
- **Roadmap status transparency**: docs now include explicit nanobot-inspired mapping with implemented/partial/scoped items.
- **Version metadata sync**: backend package metadata moved to `0.1.9`.

## ✅ What Is Completed (Nanobot-inspired scope for `g-agent`)

- Plugin SDK extension points:
  - tools (`register_tools`)
  - channels (`register_channels`)
  - providers (`register_providers`)
- Embeddable Python runtime API:
  - `from g_agent.agent import Agent`
- Memory + multimodal runtime baseline:
  - persistent memory + recall ranking
  - multimodal outbound (`text`/`image`/`voice`/`sticker`/`document`)

## ⏳ What Is Not Fully Completed Yet

- Full video-native multimodal understanding remains future work.
- We intentionally keep a focused channel surface for reliability; QQ/DingTalk are out of current scope.

## 🐛 Fixes

- `Agent` provider bootstrap now accepts plugin-registered provider factories, including `default` factory fallback.
- CLI runtime paths (`gateway`, `agent`, `digest`) now honor plugin provider factories before failing API-key preflight.
- Plugin diagnostics now show `providers` hook in `g-agent plugins list`.

## 📚 Notes

- Detailed mapping lives in `docs/roadmap/openclaw-delta.md` under **Nanobot-inspired Status (Discussion #431 Mapping)**.
- This release keeps historical `v0.1.8` bridge-hardening notes unchanged and adds the missing provider-plugin completion in `v0.1.9`.
