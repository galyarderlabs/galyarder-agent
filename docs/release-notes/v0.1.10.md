# Release v0.1.10

## ✨ Highlights

- **Voice/media outbound stabilization**: explicit voice requests now route to real media delivery on chat channels even when model output is stale.
- **Runtime guard hardening**: stale text-only/approval denial responses are rewritten or recovered into contextual voice payloads.
- **Command/channel reliability**: Telegram `/pack` command is now handled through the standard inbound processing pipeline.

## ➕ Added

- Auto media-delivery path in `AgentLoop` for explicit `voice`/`image`/`sticker` requests on Telegram/WhatsApp when `message` tool was not called.
- Voice-content recovery pass to regenerate contextual payloads when draft output contains stale capability denial text.
- Expanded regression coverage for runtime checkpoints:
  - stale voice denial rewrite (EN/ID)
  - approval-required/meta reply rewrite recovery
  - non-delivery voice-topic and negated-voice protection
  - persistent memory truth enforcement for Indonesian phrasing.
- Telegram channel test coverage for `/pack` command forwarding.

## 🔄 Changed

- Prompt/tool guidance now clearly states `message` supports outbound media (`voice`, `image`, `audio`, `sticker`, `document`) and should not be treated as text-only.
- Delivery-mode detection in runtime now includes broader Indonesian phrasing (including `dengan suara`) with negation-aware matching.
- Workflow/approval test scenarios tightened for silent media paths.

## 🐛 Fixes

- Prevented stale “text-only / approval required” replies from leaking as final voice output in explicit voice requests.
- Ensured auto voice-delivery tests are deterministic in CI by stubbing local TTS generation path.
- Improved correctness of memory truth guard against “no cross-conversation memory” Indonesian variants.

## 📚 Notes

- This release is published via the tag-triggered `release.yml` workflow.
- For local global usage, reinstall/update after release (for this repo path deployment):
